# Project Title: To Do List

## 📋 Description
<!-- This is a [brief project description]. The project is built using **React JS** and demonstrates [mention key features or functionality]. -->
It's a todo list app that fetches some data from an API (jsonplacefolder.typicode.com/todos) on a frontend web page that you can update,
 and also gives you the option to add new data. This way you can click and create a new data that gets added to your list.

And I have also added many features in it like, you can update the data which get from API, and after that more data can 
also be added by clicking on Add new button which will be visible to you as per your API. The next data appears.
